        "content": "Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Atorvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with atorvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks."

Very tiny pieces of the capsule may reach your mouth or throat, but they are not harmful if swallowed or inhaled. The capsule is less likely to break if you are careful to store the capsules properly, to keep the capsules in the foil package until you are ready to use them, and to pierce each capsule only once.Store the capsules in the package and remove them immediately before use. Dispose of any capsules that are removed from the packaging that are not used right away. Do not store the capsules inside the inhaler.

Clonidine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure.

        "content": "The combination of levodopa and carbidopa is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's-like symptoms that may develop after encephalitis (swelling of the brain) or injury to the nervous system caused by carbon monoxide poisoning or manganese poisoning. Parkinson's symptoms, including tremors (shaking), stiffness, and slowness of movement, are caused by a lack of dopamine, a natural substance usually found in the brain. Levodopa is in a class of medications called central nervous system agents. It works by being converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa is in a class of medications called decarboxylase inhibitors. It works by preventing levodopa from being broken down before it reaches the brain. This allows for a lower dose of levodopa, which causes less nausea and vomiting."

        "content": "The combination of levodopa and carbidopa comes as a regular tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa also comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given into your stomach through a PEG-J tube (a tube surgically inserted through the skin and stomach wall) or sometimes through a naso-jejunal tube (NJ; a tube inserted into your nose and down to your stomach) using a special infusion pump. The regular and orally disintegrating tablets are usually taken three or four times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken two to four times a day. The extended-release capsule is usually taken three to five times a day. The suspension is usually given as a morning dose (given by infusion over 10 to 30 minutes) and then as a continuous dose (given by infusion over 16 hours), with extra doses given no more than once every 2 hours as needed to control your symptoms. Take levodopa and carbidopa at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take levodopa and carbidopa exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not chew or crush them.Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not chew, divide, or crush them. Take the first daily dose of the extended-release capsule 1 to 2 hours before eating. If you have trouble swallowing, you can carefully open the extended-release capsule, sprinkle the entire contents on 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of apple sauce, and consume the mixture immediately. Do not store the mixture for future use.To take the orally disintegrating tablet, remove the tablet from the bottle using dry hands and immediately place it in your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.If you are switching from levodopa (Dopar or Larodopa; no longer available in the US) to the combination of levodopa and carbidopa, follow your doctor's instructions. You will probably be told to wait at least 12 hours after your last dose of levodopa to take your first dose of levodopa and carbidopa.Your doctor may start you on a low dose of levodopa and carbidopa and gradually increase your dose of the regular or orally disintegrating tablet every day or every other day as needed. Your doctor may gradually increase your dose of the extended-release tablet or capsule after 3 days as needed.To take the suspension, your doctor or pharmacist will show you how to use the pump to give your medication. Read the written instructions that come with the pump and the medication. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the pump and description of the keys. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Levodopa and carbidopa suspension comes in a single-use cassette to connect to the pump that will control the amount of medication you will receive during your infusion. Before use, remove the cassette containing the medication from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. Do not reuse a cassette or use it for longer than 16 hours. Dispose of the cassette at the end of the infusion even if it still contains medication.When you begin taking levodopa and carbidopa suspension, your doctor will adjust your morning and continuous infusion doses and possibly the doses of your other Parkinson's disease medications to best control your symptoms. It usually takes about 5 days to reach a stable dose of the suspension, but your doses may need to be changed again over time depending on your ongoing response to the medication. Your prescribed dose of the suspension will be programmed into your pump by your doctor. Do not change the dose or settings on your pump unless you are told to do so by your doctor. Be careful to make sure your PEG-J tube does not become kinked, knotted, or blocked as this will affect the amount of medication that you receive.Levodopa and carbidopa controls Parkinson's disease but does not cure it. It may take several months before you feel the full benefit of levodopa and carbidopa. Continue to take levodopa and carbidopa even if you feel well. Do not stop taking levodopa and carbidopa without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking levodopa and carbidopa, you could develop a serious syndrome that causes fever, rigid muscles, unusual body movements, and confusion. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If your doctor tells you to stop taking levodopa and carbidopa suspension, a healthcare professional will remove your PEG-J tube; do not remove the tube yourself.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's patient information sheet for levodopa and carbidopa and also the Medication Guide for levodopa and carbidopa suspension."

Avoid getting lindane into your eyes.If lindane gets into your eyes, wash them with water right away and get medical help if they are still irritated after washing.When you apply lindane to yourself or someone else, wear gloves made of nitrile, sheer vinyl, or latex with neoprene. Do not wear gloves made of natural latex because they will not prevent lindane from reaching your skin. Dispose of your gloves and wash your hands well when you are finished.Lindane lotion is used only to treat scabies. Do not use it to treat lice. To use the lotion, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nYour fingernails should be trimmed short and your skin should be clean, dry, and free of other oils, lotions, or creams. If you need to bathe or shower, wait 1 hour before applying lindane to allow your skin to cool.Shake the lotion well.Put some lotion on a toothbrush.

Lowering blood levels of cholesterol and fats may help reduce this buildup and may decrease your chances of developing heart conditions such as angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Results of a clinical study that compared people who took ezetimibe and simvastatin with people who took simvastatin alone found that although the group of people taking ezetimibe and simvastatin had lower amounts of cholesterol in the blood, there was no difference between the two groups in the amount of cholesterol and fat buildup on the insides of the blood vessels in the neck. It is not currently understood why the additional lowering of cholesterol levels in the blood did not lead to a greater decrease in cholesterol and fat buildup along the walls of the blood vessels in people taking ezetimibe and simvastatin. Further studies are underway to compare treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin to treatment with simvastatin alone to see if there is a difference in the risk of developing heart disease. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about the risks and benefits of treating increased amounts of cholesterol in your blood with ezetimibe and other medications.In addition to taking a cholesterol-lowering medication, making certain changes in your daily habits can also lower your blood cholesterol levels. You should eat a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol (see SPECIAL DIETARY); exercise 30 minutes on most, if not all, days; and lose weight if you are overweight."

Diphenhydramine is also used to control abnormal movements in people who have early stage parkinsonian syndrome (a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance) or who are experiencing movement problems as a side effect of a medication.Diphenhydramine will relieve the symptoms of these conditions but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Diphenhydramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Diphenhydramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms."

It works by supplying the thyroid hormones normally produced by the body.Currently, there is not enough evidence from clinical studies to support the use of liothyronine, alone or in combination with other medications, as the first choice of therapy to treat hypothyroidism."

Dispose of used needles, syringes, and injection pens in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.To use peginterferon alfa-2b injection pen, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nTake the carton containing the injection pen out of the refrigerator and allow time for it to reach room temperature. Check the expiration date printed on the carton, and do not use the carton if the expiration date has passed. Check to be sure the carton contains the following supplies: injection pen, disposable needle, and alcohol swabs. You may also need an adhesive bandage and a piece of sterile gauze to use after your injection.Look in the window of the injection pen and make sure that the cartridge holder chamber contains a white to off-white tablet that is whole or in pieces, or a powder.Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry. It is important to keep your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to prevent infection.Hold the injection pen upright (dose button down). You can use the bottom of the carton as a dosing tray to hold the pen in place. Press the two halves of the pen together firmly until you hear a click.Wait several seconds for the powder to completely dissolve.Gently turn the injection pen upside down twice to mix the solution. Do not shake the injection pen.Turn the injection pen right side up and look through the window to see if the mixed solution is completely dissolved. If there is still foam, wait until it settles. It is normal to see some small bubbles near the top of the solution. If the solution is not clear or if you see particles, do not use it, and call your doctor or pharmacist.Place the injection pen into the dose tray, with the dosing button on the bottom. Wipe the rubber cover of the injection pen with an alcohol pad.Remove the protective paper tab from the injection needle. Keep the injection pen upright in the dose tray and gently push the injection needle straight onto the injection pen. Screw the needle securely in place. You may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap for a few seconds. Wait until this stops before going to the next step.Remove the injection pen from the dose tray. Hold the pen firmly and pull the dosing button out as far as it will go, until you see the dark bands (lines) below the dosing button. Be careful not to push the dosing button in until you are ready to inject the medication.Turn the dosing button until the number that matches your prescribed dose is lined up with the dosing tab. If you are not sure which number matches your dose, stop, and call your doctor or pharmacist before you inject any medication.Choose your injection spot and clean the skin in the area with an alcohol pad. Wait for the area to dry.Remove the outer cap from the injection pen needle. There may be liquid around the inner needle cap. This is normal. Once the skin at the injection spot is dry, pull off the inner needle cap. Be careful not to touch the needle to anything.Hold the injection pen with your fingers wrapped around the pen body barrel and your thumb on the dosing button.With your other hand, pinch up the skin in the area you have cleaned for the injection. Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45 to 90 degrees.Inject the medication by pressing the dosing button down slowly and firmly until you can't push it any further. Keep your thumb pressed down on the dosing button for an additional 5 seconds to make sure you get the complete dose.Pull the injection pen needle out of your skin at the same angle you put it into your skin.Gently press the injection spot with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for a few seconds, but do not massage or rub the injection site.If there is bleeding, cover the injection spot with an adhesive bandage.Dispose of the injection pen with the needle still attached in a puncture-proof container.

Clean the rubber stoppers on the tops of both vials with an alcohol pad.Remove the protective needle cap and fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger back to the 0.7 mL mark on the barrel.Hold the sterile water vial upright without touching the cleaned top with your hands.Insert the syringe needle through the rubber stopper and press down on the plunger to inject the air from the syringe into the vial.Turn the vial upside down with the syringe still attached, and make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid. Withdraw 0.7 mL of sterile water by pulling the syringe plunger back to exactly the 0.7 mL mark.Remove the needle from the diluent vial by pulling it straight up out of the rubber stopper. Do not touch the needle to anything.Insert the needle through the rubber stopper of the peginterferon alfa-2b vial, and place the needle tip against the glass wall of the vial.Slowly inject the 0.7 mL of sterile water so that it runs down the glass inside the vial. Do not aim the stream of sterile water at the white powder in the bottom of the vial.Remove the needle from the vial by pulling the syringe straight out of the rubber stopper. Hold the safety sleeve tightly and pull it over the needle until you hear a click and the green stripe on the sleeve covers the red stripe on the needle. Dispose of the syringe in a puncture-proof container.Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until the powder is completely dissolved. If the solution is cold, roll the vial gently in your hands to warm it.If air bubbles have formed, wait until the solution has settled and all the bubbles have risen to the top of the solution and disappeared before going on to the next step.Look carefully at the liquid in the bottle. Do not inject the liquid unless it is clear, colorless, and does not contain particles.Clean the rubber stopper on the vial of peginterferon alfa-2b again with another alcohol pad.Remove the protective packaging from the second syringe. Remove the protective cap from the needle of the syringe.Fill the syringe with air by pulling the plunger back to the mL mark that matches your prescribed dose. If you are not sure which mark on the syringe matches your dose, stop and call your doctor or pharmacist before you inject the medication.Hold the vial of peginterferon alfa-2b upright without touching the cleaned top of the vial with your hands.Insert the syringe needle into the peginterferon alfa-2b solution vial, and press down on the plunger to inject the air into the vial.Hold the vial and syringe and slowly turn the vial upside down with the needle still inside the vial. Keep the tip of the needle in the solution.Slowly pull the syringe plunger back to the correct mark to withdraw the amount of peginterferon alfa-2b that your doctor prescribed.Pull the syringe straight out of the vial. Do not touch the needle to anything.Check for air bubbles in the syringe. If you see any bubbles, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up and gently tap the syringe until the bubbles rise. Then, carefully push the syringe plunger in slowly until the bubbles disappear, without pushing any of the solution out of the syringe.Choose an injection spot and clean the skin in the area with an alcohol pad. Wait for the area to dry.Remove the protective cap from the needle. Make sure the safety sleeve of the syringe is pushed firmly against the rim of the syringe so that the needle is fully exposed.Pinch up a 2-inch (5-centimeter) fold of loose skin at the injection spot. With your other hand, pick up the syringe and hold it like a pencil with the point (bevel) of the needle facing up. Push the needle approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters) into the pinched skin at a 45- to 90-degree angle, using a quick, dart-like thrust.Let the pinched skin loose and use that hand to help hold the syringe barrel.Pull the plunger of the syringe back very slightly. If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel. Do not inject. Pull the needle out at the same angle you put it into the skin, and dispose of the syringe in a puncture-proof container. Repeat the steps above to prepare a new dose using a new syringe and a new vial. If no blood comes into the syringe, inject the medication by gently pressing the plunger all the way down the syringe barrel.Hold an alcohol pad near the needle and pull the needle straight out of the skin. Press the alcohol pad over the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub or massage the injection site. If there is bleeding, cover it with a bandage.Cover the syringe with the safety sleeve the same way that you covered the first syringe. (See Step 12 above.) Dispose of the syringe and the needle in a puncture-proof container.Two hours after the injection, check the injection spot for redness, swelling, or tenderness. If you have a skin reaction and it doesn't clear up in a few days or it worsens, call your doctor or nurse."

The long-acting tablet, orally disintegrating tablets, and capsules supply some medication right away and release the remaining amount as a steady dose of medication over a longer time. All of these forms of methylphenidate are taken by mouth. The regular tablets, chewable tablets (Methylin), and solution (Methylin) are usually taken two to three times a day by adults and twice a day by children, preferably 35 to 40 minutes before meals. Adults who are taking three doses should take the last dose before 6:00 pm, so that the medication will not cause difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep. The intermediate-acting tablets are usually taken once or twice a day, in the morning and sometimes in the early afternoon 30 to 45 minutes before a meal. The long-acting capsule (Metadate CD) is usually taken once a day before breakfast; the long-acting tablet (Concerta), long-acting chewable tablet (Quillichew ER), long-acting suspension (Quillivant XR), and long-acting capsules (Aptensio XR, Ritalin LA) are usually taken once a day in the morning with or without food. The long-acting suspension (Quillivant XR) will begin to work sooner if it is taken with food. The long-acting orally disintegrating tablet (Cotempla XR-ODT) and the long-acting capsule (Adhansia XR) is usually taken once daily in the morning and should be taken consistently, either always with food or always without food. The long-acting capsule (Jornay PM) is usually taken once daily in the evening (between 6:30 pm and 9:30 pm),and should be taken consistently, at the same time every evening and either always with food or always without food.Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methylphenidate exactly as directed.Do not try to push the extended-release orally disintegrating tablet (Cotempla XR-ODT) through the blister pack foil. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it in your mouth. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva; no water is needed to swallow the tablet.You should thoroughly chew the immediate-release chewable tablets and then drink a full glass (at least 8 ounces [240 milliliters]) of water or other liquid. If you take the immediate-release chewable tablet without enough liquid, the tablet may swell and block your throat and may cause you to choke. If you have chest pain, vomiting, or trouble swallowing or breathing after taking the chewable tablet, you should call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment immediately.Swallow the intermediate-acting and long-acting tablets and capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. However, if you cannot swallow the long-acting capsules (Aptensio XR, Jornay PM, Metadate CD, Ritalin LA), you may carefully open the capsules and sprinkle the entire contents on a tablespoon of cool or room temperature applesauce, or for long-acting capsules (Adhansia XR), you may open the capsules and sprinkle the entire contents on a tablespoon of applesauce or yogurt. Swallow (without chewing) this mixture immediately after preparation (within 10 minutes if taking Adhansia XR) and then drink a glass of water to make sure you have swallowed all of the medicine. Do not store the mixture for future use.If you are taking the long-acting chewable tablet (Quillichew ER) and your doctor has told you to take part of the tablet to get the correct amount of your dose, break the 20 mg or 30 mg long-acting chewable tablet carefully along the lines that have been scored into it. However, the 40 mg long-acting chewable tablet is not scored and cannot be divided or split.If you are taking the long-acting suspension (Quillivant XR), follow these steps to measure the dose:\r\n\r\nRemove the bottle of medication and dosing dispenser from the box. Check to be sure that the bottle contains liquid medication. Call your pharmacist and do not use the medication if the bottle contains powder or if there is no dosing dispenser in the box.Shake the bottle up and down for at least 10 seconds to mix the medication evenly.Remove the bottle cap. Check that the bottle adapter has been inserted into top of the bottle.If the bottle adapter has not been inserted into the top of the bottle, insert it by placing the bottom of the adapter into the opening of the bottle and pressing down firmly on it with your thumb. Call your pharmacist if the box does not contain a bottle adapter. Do not remove the bottle adapter from the bottle once it is inserted.Insert the tip of the dosing dispenser into the bottle adapter and push the plunger all the way down.Turn the bottle upside down.Pull the plunger back to withdraw the amount of oral suspension prescribed by your doctor. If you are not sure how to correctly measure the dose your doctor has prescribed, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Remove the dosing dispenser and slowly squirt the oral suspension directly into your mouth or your child's mouth.Replace the cap on the bottle and close tightly.Clean the dosing dispenser after each use by placing it in the dishwasher or by rinsing with tap water.Your doctor may start you on a low dose of methylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.Your condition should improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen at any time during your treatment or do not improve after 1 month.Your doctor may tell you to stop taking methylphenidate from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.Some methylphenidate products may not be able to be substituted for another. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the type of methylphenidate product your doctor has prescribed."

Canagliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

Transdermal estradiol is also used to prevent osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who are experiencing or have experienced menopause. Women who need to use transdermal estradiol for more than one of these reasons can benefit most from the medication. Women whose only bothersome symptoms are vaginal dryness, itching, or burning may benefit more from an estrogen product that is applied topically to the vagina. Women who only need a medication to prevent osteoporosis may benefit more from a different medication that does not contain estrogen. Most brands of estradiol transdermal patches are also sometimes used as a source of estrogen in young women who do not produce enough estrogen naturally. Estradiol is in a class of medications called estrogen hormones. It works by replacing estrogen that is normally produced by the body.Menostar\u00ae brand patches contain less estrogen than other brands of estradiol transdermal patches.

Always apply your transdermal patch on the same day(s) of the week every week. There may be a calendar on the inner flap of your medication carton where you can keep track of your patch change schedule. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use transdermal estradiol exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.Your doctor will start you on a low dose of transdermal estradiol and may increase your dose if your symptoms are still bothersome. If you are already taking or using an estrogen medication, your doctor will tell you how to switch from the estrogen medication you are taking or using to transdermal estradiol. Be sure you understand these instructions. Talk to your doctor about how well transdermal estradiol works for you.You should apply estradiol patches to clean, dry, cool skin in the lower stomach area, below your waistline. Some brands of patches may also be applied to the upper buttocks or the hips. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that comes with your patches to find the best place(s) to apply the brand of patches you have received. Do not apply any brand of estradiol patches to the breasts or to skin that is oily, damaged, cut, or irritated. Do not apply estradiol patches to the waistline where they may be rubbed off by tight clothing or to the lower buttocks where they may be rubbed off by sitting. Be sure that the skin in the area where you plan to apply an estradiol patch is free of lotion, powders, or creams. After you apply a patch to a particular area, wait at least 1 week before applying another patch to that spot. Some brands of patches should not be applied to an area of the skin that is exposed to sunlight. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out whether your patch should be applied to an area that will not be exposed to sunlight.Talk to your doctor or pharmacist or read the manufacturer's information that came with your medication to find out if you need to be careful when you swim, bathe, shower, or use a sauna while wearing an estradiol transdermal patch. Some brands of patches are not likely to be affected by these activities, but some brands of patches may loosen. Some types of patches may also be pulled and loosened by your clothes or towel when you change clothes or dry your body. You may need to check that your patch is still firmly attached after these activities.If the patch loosens or falls off before it is time to replace it, try to press it back in place with your fingers. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers while you are doing this. If the patch cannot be pressed back on, fold it in half so it sticks to itself, dispose of it safely, so that it is out of the reach of children and pets, and apply a fresh patch to a different area. Replace the fresh patch on your next scheduled patch change day.Each brand of estradiol transdermal patches should be applied following the specific directions given in the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully before you start using estradiol transdermal and each time you refill your prescription. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estradiol transdermal patch.\r\n\r\nTear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not use scissors because they may damage the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.Remove the patch from the pouch. There may be a silver foil sticker used to protect the patch from moisture inside the pouch. Do not remove this sticker from the pouch.Remove the protective liner from the patch and press the sticky side of the patch against your skin in the area you have chosen to wear your patch. Some patches have a liner that is made to peel off in two pieces. If your patch has that type of liner, you should peel off one part of the liner and press that side of the patch against your skin. Then fold back the patch, peel off the other part of the liner and press the second side of the patch against your skin. Always be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.Press down on the patch with your fingers or palm for 10 seconds. Be sure that the patch is firmly attached to your skin, especially around its edges.Wear the patch all the time until it is time to remove it. When it is time to remove the patch, slowly peel it off of your skin. Fold the patch in half so that the sticky sides are pressed together and dispose of it safely, so that is out of reach of children and pets.Some brands of patches may leave a sticky substance on your skin. In some cases, this can be rubbed off easily. In other cases, you should wait 15 minutes and then remove the substance using an oil or lotion. Read the information that came with your patches to find out what to do if a substance is left on your skin after you remove your patch.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use beclomethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with beclomethasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting after you begin to use beclomethasone.Beclomethasone controls symptoms of asthma but does not cure it. Improvement in your asthma may occur as soon as 24 hours after using the medication, but full effects may not be seen for 1 to 4 weeks after using it regularly. Continue to use beclomethasone even if you feel well. Do not stop using beclomethasone without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor if your symptoms or your child's symptoms do not improve during the first 4 weeks or if they get worse.Beclomethasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks. Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment.Do not use your beclomethasone inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.Each beclomethasone inhaler is designed to provide 50, 100, or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Throw away the inhaler after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.Before you use beclomethasone inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the right way to use the inhaler. Practice using the inhaler in front of him or her, so you are sure you are doing it the right way.To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nKeep the inhaler clean and dry with the cover tightly in place at all times. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.Remove the protective cap.If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 2 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.Hold the inhaler in the upright (mouthpiece up) or horizontal position. Place the mouthpiece between your lips well into your mouth. Tilt your head slightly back. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece keeping your tongue below it. Inhale slowly and deeply. Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. At the same time, press down once on the container to spray the medication into your mouth.When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.Try to hold your breath for about 5 to 10 seconds, then breathe out gently.If your doctor has told you to take more than 1 puff per treatment, repeat steps 3 through 7.Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.After each treatment, rinse your mouth with water and spit.

Exenatide is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Exenatide also slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite. Exenatide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Exenatide is not used instead of insulin to treat people with diabetes who need insulin.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health.

If you are using the inhaler, keep your eyes closed when you use the medication. If you are using the nebulizer solution, you should use a nebulizer with a mouthpiece instead of a face mask. If you must use a face mask, ask your doctor how you can prevent the medication from leaking. If you get ipratropium in your eyes, you may develop narrow angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition that may cause loss of vision). If you already have narrow angle glaucoma, your condition may worsen. You may experience widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), eye pain or redness, blurred vision, and vision changes such as seeing halos around lights. Call your doctor if you get ipratropium into your eyes or if you develop these symptoms.The inhaler that comes with ipratropium aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of ipratropium.

Place the metal canister inside the clear end of the inhaler. Be sure that it is fully and firmly in place and that the canister is at room temperature.Remove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. If the dust cap was not placed on the mouthpiece, check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objectsIf you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in 3 days, prime it by pressing down on the canister to release two sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray medication into your eyes while you are priming the inhaler.Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.Hold the inhaler between your thumb and your next two fingers with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Close your eyes.Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. At the same time, press down firmly on the canister.Hold your breath for 10 seconds. Then remove the inhaler, and breathe out slowly.If you were told to use two puffs, wait at least 15 seconds and then repeat steps 4 to 7.Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.To inhale the solution using a nebulizer, follow these steps;\r\n\r\nTwist off the top of one vial of ipratropium solution and squeeze all of the liquid into the nebulizer reservoir.Connect the nebulizer reservoir to the mouthpiece or face mask.Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.Place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the face mask. Sit in an upright, comfortable position and turn on the compressor.Breathe in calmly, deeply, and evenly for about 5 to 15 minutes until mist stops forming in the nebulizer chamber.Clean your inhaler or nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler or nebulizer."

However, the patches may loosen or fall off during the day, especially if they get wet. If a patch does fall off, ask your child how and when this happened and where to find the patch. Do not use a dressing or tape to reapply a patch that has loosened or fallen off. Instead, dispose of the patch properly. Then apply a new patch to a different spot and remove the new patch at the time that you were scheduled to remove the original patch.While you are wearing the patch, do not use direct sources of heat such as hair dryers, heating pads, electric blankets, and heated waterbeds.Be careful not to touch the sticky side of a methylphenidate patch with your fingers when you are applying, removing, or throwing away the patch.

Be careful not to cut the patch. Never use a patch that has been cut or damaged in any way.Remove the patch from the pouch and hold it with the protective liner facing you.Peel off half of the liner. The liner should peel off easily. If the liner is hard to remove, throw away the patch properly and use a different patch.Use the other half of the liner as a handle and apply the patch to the skin.Press the patch firmly in place and smooth it down.Hold the sticky half of the patch down with one hand. Use the other hand to pull back the other half of the patch and gently peel off the remaining piece of the protective liner.Use the palm of your hand to press the entire patch firmly in place for about 30 seconds.Go around the edges of the patch with your fingers to press the edges onto the skin. Be sure that the entire patch is firmly attached to the skin.Throw away the empty pouch and the protective liner in a closed trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Do not flush the pouch or liner down the toilet.Wash your hands after you handle the patch.Record the time that you applied the patch on the administration chart that comes with the patches. Use the timetable in the patient information that comes with the patches to find the time that the patch should be removed. Do not follow these times if your doctor has told you to use the patch for less than 9 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and ask your doctor if you do not know when you should remove the patch.When it is time to remove the patch, use your fingers to peel it off slowly. If the patch is stuck tightly to your skin, apply an oil-based product such as olive oil, mineral oil, or petroleum jelly to the edges of the patch and gently spread the oil under the patch. If the patch is still hard to remove, call your doctor or pharmacist. Do not use adhesive remover or nail polish remover to loosen the patch.Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and press firmly to seal it shut.

        "content": "Human insulin  is used to control blood sugar in people who have type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or in people who have type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) that cannot be controlled with oral medications alone. Human insulin is in a class of medications called hormones. Human insulin is used to take the place of insulin that is normally produced by the body. It works by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar. All of the types of insulin that are available work in this way. The types of insulin differ only in how quickly they begin to work and how long they continue to control blood sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes."

        "content": "Human insulin comes as a solution (liquid) and a suspension (liquid with particles that will settle on standing). to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Human insulin is usually injected subcutaneously several times a day, and more than one type of insulin may be needed. Your doctor will tell you which type(s) of insulin to use, how much insulin to use, and how often to inject insulin. Follow these directions carefully. Do not use more or less insulin or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Human insulin (Myxredlin, Humulin R U-100, Novolin R) solution may also be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting. A doctor or nurse will carefully monitor you for side effects.Human insulin controls high blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to use human insulin even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you use without talking to your doctor.Human insulin comes in vials, prefilled disposable dosing devices, and cartridges. The cartridges are designed to be placed in dosing pens. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication. Make sure that the name and letter on your insulin are exactly what your doctor prescribed.If your human insulin comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Be sure that you know whether your human insulin is U-100 or U-500 and always use a syringe marked for that type of insulin. Always use the same brand and model of needle and syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to draw insulin into a syringe and inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to inject your dose.If your human insulin comes in cartridges, you may need to buy an insulin pen separately. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the type of pen you should use. Carefully read the instructions that come with your pen, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it.If your human insulin comes in a disposable dosing device, read the instructions that come with the device carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the device.Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Dispose of needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.Your doctor may tell you to mix two types of insulin in the same syringe. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to draw both types of insulin into the syringe. Follow these directions carefully. Always draw the same type of insulin into the syringe first, and always use the same brand of needles. Never mix more than one type of insulin in a syringe unless you are told to do so by your doctor.Always look at your human insulin before you inject. If you are using a regular human insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R), the insulin should be as clear, colorless, and fluid as water. Do not use this type of insulin if it appears cloudy, thickened, or colored, or if it has solid particles. If you are using an NPH human insulin (Humulin N, Novolin N) or a premixed insulin that contains NPH (Humulin 70/30, Novolin 70/30), the insulin should appear cloudy or milky after you mix it. Do not use these types of insulin if there are clumps in the liquid or if there are solid white particles sticking to the bottom or walls of the bottle. Do not use any type of insulin after the expiration date printed on the bottle has passed.Some types of human insulin must be shaken or rotated to mix before use. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if the type of insulin you are using should be mixed and how you should mix it if necessary.Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about where on your body you should inject human insulin. You can inject your human insulin in the stomach , upper arm, upper leg, or buttocks. Do not inject human insulin into muscles, scars, or moles. Use a different site for each injection, at least 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) away from the previous injection site but in the same general area (for example, the thigh). Use all available sites in the same general area before switching to a different area (for example, the upper arm)."

Nevirapine should not be used to treat healthcare workers or other individuals exposed to HIV infection after contact with HIV-contaminated blood, tissues, or other body fluids. Nevirapine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although nevirapine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people."

Never use a household teaspoon to measure doses of oseltamivir oral suspension.If you are giving the commercial suspension to an adult or child over one year of age, follow these steps to measure the dose using the syringe provided:\r\n\r\nShake the suspension well (for about 5 seconds) before each use to mix the medication evenly.Open the bottle by pushing down on the cap and turning the cap at the same time.Push the plunger of the measuring device completely down to the tip.Insert the tip of the measuring device firmly into the opening on the top of the bottle.Turn the bottle (with the measuring device attached) upside down.Pull back on the plunger slowly until the amount of suspension prescribed by your doctor fills the measuring device to the appropriate marking. Some larger doses may need to be measured using the measuring device twice. If you are not sure how to correctly measure the dose your doctor has prescribed, ask your doctor or pharmacist.Turn the bottle (with the measuring device attached) right-side up and slowly remove the measuring device.Take oseltamivir directly into your mouth from the measuring device; do not mix with any other liquids.Replace the cap on the bottle and close tightly.Remove the plunger from the rest of the measuring device and rinse both parts under running tap water. Allow the parts to air dry before putting back together for the next use.Call your doctor or pharmacist to find out how you should measure a dose of oseltamivir suspension if you do not have the measuring device that came with this medication.If you have difficulty swallowing capsules, your doctor may tell you to open the capsule and mix the contents with a sweetened liquid. To prepare doses of oseltamivir for people who cannot swallow the capsules:\r\n\r\nHold the capsule over a small bowl and carefully pull open the capsule and empty all of the powder from the capsule into the bowl. If your doctor has instructed you to take more than one capsule for your dose, then open the correct number of capsules into the bowl.Add a small amount of sweetened liquid, such as regular or sugar-free chocolate syrup, corn syrup, caramel topping, or light brown sugar dissolved in water to the powder.Stir the mixture.Swallow the entire contents of this mixture right away.Continue to take oseltamivir until you finish the prescription, even if you start to feel better. Do not stop taking oseltamivir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking oseltamivir too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be fully treated, or you may not be protected from the flu.If you feel worse or develop new symptoms while taking oseltamivir, or if your flu symptoms do not start to get better, call your doctor.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

When the number that shows on the counter is 020, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 000, you should not use that canister anymore. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.Before you use your ciclesonide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.Do not use your ciclesonide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source.

Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.Breathe out through your mouth.Hold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it, keeping your tongue below it.Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.Try to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out gently.Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.Clean your inhaler once a week. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water."

The solution for oral inhalation is usually used three times a day, once every 6 to 8 hours. The inhaler is usually used every 4 to 6 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use levalbuterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.If your asthma symptoms become worse, if levalbuterol inhalation becomes less effective, or if you need more doses than usual of the asthma medications you use as needed, your condition may be getting worse. Do not use extra doses of levalbuterol. Call your doctor right away.Levalbuterol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure these conditions. Continue to use levalbuterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using levalbuterol without talking to your doctor.If you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in canisters. Each canister of levalbuterol aerosol is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed.You will need to keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.The inhaler that comes with levalbuterol aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of albuterol. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and do not use any other inhaler to inhale levalbuterol.Be careful not to get levalbuterol inhalation into your eyes.Do not use your levalbuterol inhaler when you are near a flame or source of heat. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.Before you use levalbuterol for the first time, read the written instructions that come with the inhaler or nebulizer. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler or nebulizer while he or she watches.If your child will be using the inhaler, be sure that he or she knows how to use it. Watch your child each time he or she uses the inhaler to be sure that he or she is using it correctly.To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nRemove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objects. Be sure that the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the mouthpiece.Shake the inhaler well.If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 3 days, you will need to prime it. To prime the inhaler, press down on the canister four times to release four sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to get albuterol in your eyes.Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth.Hold the canister with the mouthpiece on the bottom, facing you, and the canister pointing upward. Place the open end of the mouthpiece into your mouth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece.At the same time, press down once on the container with your middle finger to spray the medication into your mouth.As soon as the medication is released, remove your finger from the canister and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth.Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds.If you were told to use two puffs, wait 1 minute and then repeat steps 4 to 8.Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.To use the solution or the concentrated solution for oral inhalation, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nOpen the foil pouch by tearing through the rough edge along the side of the pouch and remove one vial. Leave the rest of the vials inside the foil pouch to protect them from light. Look at the solution in the vial to be sure it is colorless. If it is not colorless, call your doctor or pharmacist and do not use the solution.Twist off the top of the vial and squeeze all of the liquid into the reservoir of your nebulizer. Do not add any other medications to the nebulizer because it may not be safe to mix them with levalbuterol. Use all nebulized medications separately unless your doctor specifically tells you to mix them.If you are using the concentrated solution, add the amount of normal saline that your doctor told you to use to the reservoir. Gently swirl the nebulizer to mix the normal saline and the concentrated solution.Connect the nebulizer reservoir to your mouthpiece or facemask.Connect the nebulizer to the compressor.Sit upright and place the mouthpiece in your mouth or put on the facemask.Turn on the compressor.Breathe calmly, deeply, and evenly until mist stops forming in the nebulizer. This should take between 5 and 15 minutes.Clean the nebulizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.Clean your inhaler or nebulizer regularly. Follow the manufacturer's directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about cleaning your inhaler or nebulizer. If you do not clean your inhaler properly, the inhaler may become blocked and may not spray medication. If this happens, follow the manufacturer's directions for cleaning the inhaler and removing the blockage."

If these problems occur, call your doctor immediately. You may need to increase your dose of tablets or liquid temporarily or start taking them again.Take triamcinolone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor."

Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation."

Pantoprazole is used to allow the esophagus to heal and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults with GERD. It is also used to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Pantoprazole is in a class of medications called proton-pump inhibitors.

The packets of delayed-release granules must be mixed with applesauce or apple juice and taken by mouth or given through a feeding tube. For the treatment and maintenance of GERD, pantoprazole is usually taken once a day. For the treatment of conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, pantoprazole is usually taken twice a day. The delayed-release tablets are usually taken with or without food, and the granules are usually taken 30 minutes before a meal. Take pantoprazole at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pantoprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If your doctor has prescribed the 40 mg tablet and it is too big for you to swallow, ask your doctor to prescribe two of the 20 mg tablets instead.To take the granules, open the packet and either sprinkle the granules onto one teaspoonful of applesauce or into a cup containing one teaspoonful of apple juice. Do not mix the granules with water, other liquids, or other foods. Use all of the granules in the packet; do not divide the granules into smaller doses. If you sprinkle the granules into apple juice, stir the mixture for 5 seconds. Swallow the mixture of applesauce or apple juice and medication right away (within 10 minutes) without chewing or crushing the granules. If you sprinkled the granules on applesauce, take several sips of water to wash the granules down to your stomach. If you sprinkled the granules into apple juice, rinse the cup once or twice with apple juice and drink the apple juice right away to be sure you swallow any leftover granules.Pantoprazole granules mixed with apple juice may be given through a feeding tube. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor how you should take pantoprazole.Continue to take pantoprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pantoprazole without talking to your doctor.

Simvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (''bad cholesterol'') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (''good cholesterol'') in the blood. Simvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Simvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body.

The intrauterine systems may be removed by a doctor any time that you want to become pregnant or want to use a different form of birth control. If the Mirena brand intrauterine system is used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding, it may be left in place for up to 5 years after it is inserted.Your doctor will tell you the best time to have the levonorgestrel intrauterine system inserted. Depending on the timing, you may need to use a non-hormonal birth control method such as condoms and spermicide for 7 days to prevent pregnancy if sexual intercourse occurs. Your intrauterine system may be inserted immediately after a first-trimester miscarriage or abortion. If you have given birth, had a miscarriage, or had a second-trimester abortion, your intrauterine system should not be inserted until at least 6 weeks have passed and a physical exam shows that your uterus has recovered from the pregnancy.You will need to have your intrauterine system inserted in your health-care provider's office or clinic. Your health-care provider may tell you to take a nonprescription pain reliever prior to your appointment to help decrease cramping during and after the placement. You may experience some of these symptoms during and after the placement: sweating, pale skin, fast heartbeat, fainting, dizziness, cramping, and bleeding. Tell your health-care provider if your cramping is severe or if these symptoms last for longer than 30 minutes. Your health-care provider will check you to be sure that your system has been placed correctly.Call your doctor if you experience severe pain during the first few hours after your intrauterine system is inserted. This may be a sign of a serious infection.Your health-care provider will place your intrauterine system into your uterus, but will leave two threads dangling through your cervix. You should check for these threads once a month so that you will know whether your intrauterine system is still in place. To check for the threads, you should wash your hands with soap and water. Then, reach up to the top of your vagina with clean fingers to feel the threads. If you cannot feel the threads or if you feel any part of the intrauterine system other than the threads, your intrauterine system may not be in place and may not prevent pregnancy. If this happens, call your doctor and use a non-hormonal birth control method such as condoms and spermicide to prevent pregnancy until you are seen by your doctor.You will need a follow-up appointment with your health-care provider 4-6 weeks after your intrauterine system is inserted to be sure that your system is properly in place. After this appointment, you will need to be examined once every year or more often if you have any problems or concerns.If your levonorgestrel intrauterine system must be removed, talk to your doctor about the best time to remove it. You are not protected from pregnancy once your intrauterine system is removed, so if you do not want to become pregnant, you will need to be sure that you have effective birth control as soon as your intrauterine system is removed. If you plan to have your intrauterine system replaced with a new intrauterine system, you can have the old system removed and the new system inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle. If you have chosen to use a different form of birth control instead of your intrauterine system and you have regular menstrual cycles, you should have the system removed during the first 7 days after your menstrual period begins and begin using your new form of birth control right away. If you have chosen to use a different form of birth control and you do not have regular cycles, you do not menstruate at all, or you are not able to have your intrauterine system removed during the first 7 days of your menstrual period, you should start using your new form of birth control 7 days before your intrauterine system is removed.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

If you or your child wake up before the alarm goes off and it has been at least 2 1/2 hours since you took your first dose, take your second dose, turn off the alarm, and go back to sleep.Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of sodium oxybate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.Sodium oxybate may be habit forming. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much sodium oxybate, you may experience life-threatening symptoms including seizures, slowed or stopped breathing, loss of consciousness, and coma. You may also develop a craving for sodium oxybate, feel a need to take larger and larger doses, or want to continue taking sodium oxybate even though it causes unpleasant symptoms. If you have taken sodium oxybate in amounts larger than prescribed by your doctor, and you suddenly stop taking it, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness, anxiety, abnormal thinking, loss of contact with reality, sleepiness, upset stomach, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, sweating, muscle cramps, and fast heartbeat.Sodium oxybate may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take sodium oxybate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sodium oxybate without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking sodium oxybate, you may have more attacks of cataplexy and you may experience anxiety and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.To prepare doses of sodium oxybate, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nOpen the carton that your medicine came in and remove the bottle of medication and the measuring device.Remove the measuring device from its wrapper.Open the bottle by pushing down on the cap and turning the cap counterclockwise (to the left) at the same time.Place the open bottle upright on a table.Hold the bottle upright with one hand. Use your other hand to place the tip of the measuring device in the center opening on the top of the bottle. Press the tip firmly into the opening.Hold the bottle and measuring device with one hand. Use your other hand to pull back on the plunger until it is even with the marking that matches the dose your doctor prescribed. Be sure to keep the bottle upright to allow the medication to flow into the measuring device.Remove the measuring device from the top of the bottle. Place the tip of the measuring device in one of the dosing cups provided with the medication.Press down on the plunger to empty the medication into the dosing cup.Add 2 ounces (60 milliliters, 1/4 cup, or about 4 tablespoons) of tap water to the dosing cup. The medication will taste best if you mix it with cold water. Do not mix the medication with fruit juice, soft drinks, or any other liquid.Repeat steps 5 through 9 to prepare a dose of sodium oxybate in the second dosing cup.Place the caps on both dosing cups. Turn each cap clockwise (to the right) until it clicks and locks in place.Rinse the measuring device with water.Replace the cap on the bottle of sodium oxybate and return the bottle and measuring device to a safe place where they are stored away from children and pets. Place both prepared dosing cups of medication in a safe place near your bed or in safe place to give your child that is out of the reach of children and pets.When it is time for you to take the first dose of sodium oxybate, press down on the cap and turn it counterclockwise (to the left). Drink all of the liquid while you are sitting on your bed. Put the cap back on the cup, turn it clockwise (to the right) to lock it in place, and lie down right away.When you wake up 2 1/2 to 4 hours later to take the second dose, repeat step 14."

After receiving the naloxone nasal spray, a person should stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives.To give the inhaler, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nLay the person on their back to give the medication.Remove the naloxone nasal spray from the box. Peel back the tab to open the spray.Do not prime the nasal spray before using it.Hold the naloxone nasal spray with your thumb on the bottom of the plunger and your first and middle fingers on either side of the nozzle.Gently insert the tip of the nozzle into one nostril, until your fingers on either side of the nozzle are against the bottom of the person's nose. Provide support to the back of the person's neck with your hand to allow the head to tilt back.Press the plunger firmly to release the medication.Remove the nasal spray nozzle from the nostril after giving the medication.Turn the person on their side (recovery position) and call for emergency medical assistance immediately after giving the first naloxone dose.If the person does not respond by waking up, to voice or touch, or breathing normally or responds and then relapses, give another dose. If needed, give additional doses (repeating steps 2 through 7) every 2 to 3 minutes in alternate nostrils with a new nasal spray each time until emergency medical assistance arrives.Put the used nasal spray(s) back in the container and out of reach of children until you can safely dispose of it.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed without liquid. If necessary, liquid can be used to take the orally disintegrating tablet.Swallow the tablets and the tablet with a sensor whole; do not divide, crush, or chew.The tablets that contain a small sensor come with a patch (a wearable sensor) that detects a signal from the tablet and a smartphone application (app) to display information about how you are taking the medication. The app must be downloaded onto your smartphone before you start the medication. Apply your patch to the left side of the body above the lower edge of the rib cage only when prompted by the smartphone app instructions. Do not place the patch in areas where the skin is scraped, cracked, inflamed, or irritated or in a location that overlaps the area of the most recently removed patch. Change the patch weekly or sooner, if needed. The app reminds you to change the patch and explains how to apply and remove the patch correctly. Keep the patch on when showering, swimming, or exercising. If undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body), remove the patch and replace it with a new one as soon as possible. If the patch causes skin irritation, remove it and tell your doctor. After you take the medication, the tablets can be detected in the body by the app within 30 minutes to 2 hours. If the tablet is not detected after ingestion, do not take another dose. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about how to take the tablets and use the patch or smartphone app.Your doctor may start you on a low dose of aripiprazole and gradually increase or decrease your dose depending on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience.Aripiprazole may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. It may take 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of aripiprazole. Continue to take aripiprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking aripiprazole without talking to your doctor."

Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while he or she watches.The dose counter on the base of your mometasone inhaler tells you how many doses of medication are left in your inhaler. Read the numbers on the dose counter from top to bottom. The number on the dose counter decreases every time you lift the cap to load a dose of medication. Do not use the inhaler if the numbers on the dose counter do not change after you load a dose. Call your pharmacist if your inhaler is not working properly.To use the aerosol inhaler, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nRemove the cap from the mouthpiece.If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 5 days, prime it by releasing 4 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face. Shake the inhaler prior to each inhalation.Breathe out through your mouth.Hold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it.Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.Try to hold your breath for about 30 seconds, then breathe out gently.If your doctor has told you to take more than one puffs per treatment, repeat steps 3 through 7.Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.Clean your aerosol inhaler once a week. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth.

Write the date that you opened the inhaler in the space provided on the cap label.Hold the inhaler straight up with the colored base on the bottom. Twist the white cap counterclockwise and remove it. This loads the correct amount of medication in the base of the inhaler, so it is important to twist the cap and not twist the base with your hand. As you lift the cap off, the dose counter on the base will count down by one to show the number of doses left after this use.Breathe out fully.Hold the inhaler on its side with the mouthpiece facing you. Be sure that you are not covering the ventilation holes on the sides of the inhaler. Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler in your mouth and close your lips firmly around it.Breathe in a fast, deep breath. You will receive your medication as a very fine powder, so you may not be able to smell, feel, or taste it as you inhale.Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Do not breathe out into the inhaler.Wipe the mouthpiece dry. Put the cap back onto the inhaler so that the indented arrow is in line with the dose counter. Gently press down and turn clockwise until you hear a click.Rinse your mouth with water and spit. Do not swallow the water.If your inhaler needs to be cleaned, gently wipe it with a dry cloth.

Ramipril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently.High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure.

Cyclosporine (modified) oral solution may be mixed with orange juice or apple juice but should not be mixed with milk. Cyclosporine oral solution may be mixed with milk, chocolate milk, or orange juice. You should choose one drink from the appropriate list and always mix your medication with that drink.To take either type of oral solution, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nFill a glass (not plastic) cup with the drink you have chosen.Remove the protective cover from the top of the dosing syringe that came with your medication.Place the tip of the syringe into the bottle of solution and pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe with the amount of solution your doctor has prescribed.Hold the syringe over the liquid in your glass and press down on the plunger to place the medication in the glass.Stir the mixture well.Drink all of the liquid in the glass right away.Pour a little more of the drink you have chosen into the glass, swirl the glass around to rinse, and drink the liquid.Dry the outside of the syringe with a clean towel and replace the protective cover. Do not wash the syringe with water. If you do need to wash the syringe, be sure that it is completely dry before you use it to measure another dose."

If the infusion site is red, itchy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site.When using insulin apart solution in an external insulin pump, high blood sugar may occur quickly if the pump stops working properly or if the insulin in the pump reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures greater than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen). Make sure you have back-up insulin and any necessary supplies on hand, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use them.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

Talk to your doctor about these symptoms and be sure you understand how to tell when you are having a serious allergic reaction and should inject epinephrine.Keep your automatic injection device with you or available at all times so that you will be able to inject epinephrine quickly when an allergic reaction begins.

If your symptoms continue or return after the first injection, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose of epinephrine injection with a new injection device.

Do not inject epinephrine into the buttocks or any other part of your body such as fingers, hands, or feet or into a vein. Do not put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the needle area of the automatic injection device. If epinephrine is accidently injected into these areas, get emergency medical treatment immediately.After you inject a dose of epinephrine injection, some solution will remain in the injection device. This is normal and does not mean that you did not receive the full dose. Do not use the extra liquid; dispose of the remaining liquid and device properly.

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ciclesonide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Ciclesonide nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it in your eyes or directly onto the nasal septum (the wall between the two nostrils).Ciclesonide controls the symptoms of rhinitis but does not cure it. Your symptoms probably will not begin to improve for at least 24-48 hours after your first dose and it may be longer before you feel the full benefit of ciclesonide. Continue to use ciclesonide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ciclesonide without talking to your doctor.Each bottle of ciclesonide nasal spray is designed to provide 120 sprays after the bottle is primed initially. The bottle must be disposed of after 4 months of use. You should count 4 months from the date that the bottle is removed from the foil pouch and write it on the sticker that is provided in the carton. Place the sticker in the space provided on the bottle to remind you of this date. It is also important to keep track of the number of sprays you have used and dispose of the bottle after you have used 120 sprays, even if the bottle still contains some liquid and it is before the 4 months have passed.To use the nasal spray, follow these steps: \r\n\r\nShake the bottle gently and remove the dust cover.If you are using the pump for the first time, point the bottle away from your body and press down and release the pump eight times. If you have used the pump before but not within the last 4 days, press down and release the pump one time or until you see a fine spray.Blow your nose until your nostrils are clear.Hold one nostril closed with your finger.With your other hand, hold the bottle firmly with your forefinger and middle finger on either side of the spray tip while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb.Tilt your head slightly forward and carefully put the tip of the nasal applicator into your open nostril keeping the bottle upright. Begin to breathe through your nose.While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press quickly and firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.Repeat steps 4-7 in the other nostril, unless your doctor has told you otherwise.Wipe the applicator tip with a clean tissue and replace the dust cover."

Never use more than one contraceptive ring at a time and always insert and remove the ring according to the schedule your doctor gives you.Contraceptive vaginal rings come in different brands. Different brands of contraceptive rings contain slightly different medications or doses, are used in slightly different ways, and have different risks and benefits. Be sure that you know which brand of contraceptive vaginal ring you are using and exactly how you should use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and read it carefully.Your doctor will tell you when you should insert your first contraceptive vaginal ring. This depends on whether you were using another type of birth control in the past month, were not using birth control, or have recently given birth or had an abortion or miscarriage. In some cases, you may need to use an additional method of birth control for the first 7 days that you use the contraceptive ring. Your doctor will tell you whether you need to use backup birth control and will help you choose a method, such as male condoms and/or spermicides. You should not use a diaphragm, cervical cap, or a female condom when a contraceptive ring is in place.If you are using the NuvaRing\u00ae vaginal ring, insert a new ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break, using a new vaginal ring for each cycle.If you are using the Annovera\u00ae vaginal ring, re-insert the clean vaginal ring after the 1-week break; repeat the cycle of 3 weeks of use with a 1-week break for up to 13 cycles.The contraceptive ring will usually stay in your vagina until you remove it. It may sometimes slip out when you are removing a tampon, during intercourse, or having a bowel movement. Call your doctor if your contraceptive ring slips out often.If your NuvaRing\u00ae contraceptive ring slips out, you should rinse it with cool or lukewarm (not hot) water and try to replace it within 3 hours. However, if your NuvaRing\u00ae contraceptive ring slips out and it is broken, discard it and replace it with a new vaginal ring. If your ring falls out and gets lost, you should replace it with a new ring and remove the new ring at the same time you were scheduled to remove the ring that was lost. If you do not replace your NuvaRing\u00ae vaginal ring within the appropriate time, you must use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.If your Annovera\u00ae contraceptive vaginal ring falls out, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and try to replace it within 2 hours. If your vaginal ring is out of place for more than a total of 2 hours over the cycle of 3 weeks that the vaginal ring is to be inserted (e.g., from falling out one time or several times), you must use a non-hormonal backup method of birth control (e.g., condoms with spermicide) until you have had the ring in place for 7 days in a row.Regularly check for the presence of the vaginal ring in the vagina before and after intercourse.Contraceptive vaginal rings will work only as long as they are used regularly.

It is also used in combination with other medications to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. Insulin inhalation is not used for the treatment diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Insulin inhalation is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin inhalation works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping to move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

This is a sign that fluorouracil is working. Do not stop using fluorouracil unless your doctor has told you to do so.Apply fluorouracil cream with a nonmetal applicator, a glove, or your finger. If you apply fluorouracil cream with your finger, be sure to wash your hands well immediately afterwards. Do not cover the treated areas with a bandage or dressing unless your doctor tells you to.Do not apply fluorouracil cream or topical solution to the eyelids or the eyes, nose, or mouth."

Octreotide immediate-release injection is also used to control diarrhea and flushing caused by carcinoid tumors (slow-growing tumors that release natural substances that can cause symptoms) and vasoactive intestinal peptide secreting adenomas (VIP-omas; tumors that form in the pancreas and release natural substances that can cause symptoms). Octreotide long-acting injection is used to control acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, and VIP-omas in people who have been successfully treated with octreotide injection but prefer to receive injections less often. Octreotide injection is in a class of medications called octapeptides. It works by decreasing the amounts of certain natural substances produced by the body."

Octreotide immediate-release injection is usually injected 2 to 4 times a day. Octreotide long-acting injection is usually injected once every 4 weeks. Inject octreotide immediate-release injection at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inject octreotide injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.If you are not already being treated with octreotide injection, you will begin your treatment with immediate-release octreotide injection. You will be treated with the immediate-release injection for 2 weeks, and your doctor may gradually increase your dose during that time. If the medication works for you and does not cause severe side effects, your doctor may give you the long-acting injection after 2 weeks. In order to control your condition, you may need to continue to receive the immediate-release injection for 2 weeks or longer after you receive your first dose of the long-acting injection. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of the long-acting injection 2 or 3 months after you first receive it.If you are being treated for a carcinoid tumor or VIP-oma, you may experience worsening of your symptoms from time to time during your treatment. If this happens, your doctor may tell you to use the immediate-release injection for a few days until your symptoms are controlled.If you have acromegaly and have been treated with radiation therapy, your doctor will probably tell you not to use octreotide immediate-release injection for 4 weeks every year or not to receive the octreotide long-acting injection for 8 weeks every year. This will allow your doctor to see how the radiation therapy has affected your condition and decide whether you should still be treated with octreotide.Octreotide immediate-release injection comes in vials, ampules, and dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your octreotide comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication.If you are using the immediate-release injection from a vial, ampule or dosing pen, you may be able to inject the medication yourself at home or have a friend or relative perform the injections.

        "content": "Insulin glulisine is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin glulisine is usually used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin glulisine also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin glulisine is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin glulisine works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes."

Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Never use insulin glulisine when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Do not inject insulin into a skin area that is red, swollen, itchy, or thickened.Insulin glulisine controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin glulisine even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin glulisine without talking to your doctor.

If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Dispose of needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.Your doctor may tell you to mix your insulin glulisine with another type of insulin (NPH insulin [Novolin N, Humulin N]) in the same syringe. Do not mix or dilute insulin glulisine with any other type of insulin. If you mix insulin glulisine with NPH insulin, draw insulin glulisine into the syringe first, then draw the NPH insulin into the syringe and inject the solution immediately after mixing.You can inject your insulin glulisine in your thighs, stomach, or upper arms. Never inject insulin glulisine into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose; try to avoid injecting the same site more often than once every 1 to 2 weeks.Always look at your insulin glulisine before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use your insulin glulisine if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.Insulin glulisine also can be used with an external insulin pump. Before using insulin glulisine in a pump system, read the pump label to make sure the pump can be used for continuous delivery of fast-acting insulin. Read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the insulin pump. Do not dilute insulin glulisine or mix it with any other type of insulin when using it in an external insulin pump. Insulin glulisine used in an external insulin pump should be infused into your stomach area. When using insulin glulisine in an external insulin pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir and change the tubing, needle, and infusion site (spot where the pump is attached to the body) at least every 48 hours. If the infusion site is red, itchy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site.When using insulin glulisine in an external insulin pump, high blood sugar may occur quickly if the pump stops working properly or if the insulin in the pump reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures greater than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. You may need to change the infusion set and insulin in the pump or infusion site if you have high blood sugar, the pump alarm sounds, or the insulin flow is blocked. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen). Make sure you have back-up insulin and any necessary supplies on hand, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use them.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

Use the contraceptive patch exactly as directed.If you are just starting to use the Twirla brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you should apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period. If you are just starting to use the Xulane brand estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch, you may apply your first patch on the first day of your menstrual period or on the first Sunday after your period begins. If you apply your first patch after the first day of your menstrual period, you must use a backup method of birth control (such as a condom and/or a spermicide) for the first 7 days of the first cycle. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist to find out when in your cycle you should start using your contraceptive patch.When changing your patch, always apply your new patch on the same day of the week (the Patch Change Day). Apply a new patch once a week for 3 weeks. During Week 4, remove the old patch but do not apply a new patch, and expect to begin your menstrual period. On the day after Week 4 ends, apply a new patch to start a new 4-week cycle even if your menstrual period has not started or has not ended. You should not go more than 7 days without a patch.Apply the contraceptive patch to a clean, dry, intact, healthy area of skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or upper torso, in a place where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not place the contraceptive patch on the breasts or on skin that is red, irritated, or cut. Do not apply makeup, creams, lotions, powders, or other topical products to the skin area where the contraceptive patch is placed.

The following general directions can help you remember some important things to do when you apply any type of estrogen and progestin contraceptive patch:\r\n\r\nTear open the pouch with your fingers. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.Remove the patch from the pouch. Be careful not to remove the clear plastic liner as you remove the patch.Peel away half or the larger part of the plastic liner. Avoid touching the sticky surface of the patch.Apply the sticky surface of the patch to the skin and remove the other part of the plastic liner. Press down firmly on the patch with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds, making sure that the edges stick well.After one week, remove the patch from your skin. Fold the used patch in half so that it sticks to itself and dispose of it so that it is out of the reach of children and pets. Do not flush the used patch down the toilet.Check your patch every day to make sure it is sticking. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for less than one day, try to reapply it in the same place immediately. Do not try to reapply a patch that is no longer sticky, that has stuck to itself or another surface, that has any material stuck to its surface or that has loosened or fallen off before. Apply a new patch instead. Your Patch Change Day will stay the same. If the patch has been partially or completely detached for more than one day, or if you do not know how long the patch has been detached, you may not be protected from pregnancy. You must start a new cycle by applying a new patch immediately; the day that you apply the new patch becomes your new Patch Change Day. Use backup birth control for the first week of the new cycle.If the skin under your patch becomes irritated, you may remove the patch and apply a new patch to a different spot on the skin. Leave the new patch in place until your regular Patch Change Day. Be sure to remove the old patch because you should never wear more than one patch at a time.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Your doctor will start you on a low dose of fentanyl nasal spray and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain. Talk to your doctor about how well the medication is working and whether you are experiencing any side effects so that your doctor can decide whether your dose should be adjusted. If you still have pain 30 minutes after using fentanyl nasal spray, your doctor may tell you to use another pain medication to relieve that pain, and may increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray to treat your next episode of pain. Do not increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray unless your doctor tells you that you should.Do not use fentanyl nasal spray more than four times a day. Call your doctor if you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your other pain medication(s) to better control your pain.Do not stop using fentanyl nasal spray without talking to your doctor.

It works to treat rosacea by decreasing the inflammation that causes this condition.Antibiotics such as doxycycline will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment."

Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Fluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with fluvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks."

Topiramate is also used with other medications to control seizures in people who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delays). Topiramate is also used to prevent migraine headaches but not to relieve the pain of migraine headaches when they occur.  Topiramate is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain."

        "content": "Topiramate comes as a tablet, a sprinkle capsule (capsule that contains small beads of medication that can be sprinkled on food), an extended-release (long-acting) capsule and solution (liquid) to take by mouth.  The tablets and sprinkle capsules are usually taken with or without food once or twice a day. The extended-release capsules are usually taken with or without food once a day. The solution is usually taken with or without food twice a day.  Take topiramate at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take topiramate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.There is another medication with a name similar to the brand name for topiramate. You should be sure that you receive topiramate and not the similar medication each time you fill your prescription. Be sure that the prescription your doctor gives you is clear and easy to read. Talk to your pharmacist to be sure that you are given topiramate. If you think you were given the wrong medication, talk to your pharmacist. Do not take any medication unless you are certain it is the medication that your doctor prescribed.Topiramate tablets have a bitter taste so you should swallow them whole. It is especially important that you not take topiramate tablets that have been broken for any length of time because tablets that are broken may lose their effectiveness over time.The sprinkle and extended-release capsules (Qudexy XR brand only) may be swallowed whole or opened and poured over soft food. Swallow extended-release capsules (Trokendi XR brand only) whole; do not split, chew, or sprinkle on food.To take the sprinkle capsules or extended-release capsules (Qudexy XR brand only) with food, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nPrepare a teaspoonful of soft food such as applesauce, custard, ice cream, oatmeal, pudding, or yogurt.Hold the capsule upright over the food.Twist off the top of the capsule and pour the entire contents onto the spoonful of food.Swallow the entire mixture immediately without chewing.Drink fluids right after swallowing to wash down the mixture and to be sure that you swallow all of it.Use a marked (calibrated) measuring device to measure the topiramate solution dose to make sure the correct dose is being given. Do not use a household teaspoon or tablespoon. Ask your pharmacist for an measuring device if one is not included with your medication.Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of topiramate and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.Topiramate may control your seizures or migraines but will not cure your condition. Continue to take topiramate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking topiramate without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking topiramate, you may have severe seizures, even if you have not had seizures in the past. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with topiramate and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide."

Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time.Sometimes histrelin implant is hard to feel under the skin so the doctor may have to use certain tests, such as ultrasound or MRI scans (radiology techniques designed to show the images of body structures) to find the implant when it is time to remove it. Occasionally, histrelin implant may come out through the original insertion site on its own. You may or may not notice this happening. Call your doctor right away if you think this may have happened to you.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

It is generally taken as two doses in preparation for a colonoscopy. The first dose is usually taken the night before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken the morning of the procedure. The medication may also be taken as two doses on the day before the colonoscopy, with the first dose taken the late afternoon or early evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken 6 hours later. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should take your medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.To prepare for your colonoscopy, you may not eat any solid food or drink milk beginning the day before the procedure. You should only have clear liquids during this time. Examples of clear liquids are water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles and soft drinks. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or any liquid that is red or purple. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about which liquids you may drink before your colonoscopy.If you are taking the powder (Prepopik\u00ae), you will need to mix the medication powder with cold water right before you take it. If you swallow the powder without mixing it with water, there is a greater chance that you will experience unpleasant or dangerous side effects. To prepare each dose of your medication, fill the dosing cup that was provided with the medication with cold water up to the lower line (5 ounces, 150 mL) that is marked on the cup. Pour in the contents of one packet of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid powder and stir for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the powder. The mixture may become slightly warm as the powder dissolves. Drink the entire mixture right away. Mix the medication with water only when you are ready to take it; do not prepare the mixture in advance.If you are taking the solution (Clenpiq\u00ae), drink the entire contents of one bottle of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid solution directly from the bottle for each dose you are to take. Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid solution comes ready to drink and should not be mixed with a liquid before use.If you are taking the medication the night before and the morning of your colonoscopy, you will take your first dose between 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. on the night before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce (240 mL) drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours before you go to bed. You will take your second dose the next morning, about 5 hours before your colonoscopy is scheduled. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours, but you should finish all the drinks at least 2 hours before your colonoscopy.If you are taking both doses of the medication the day before your colonoscopy, you will take your first dose between 4:00-6:00 p.m. on the evening before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours. You will take your next dose 6 hours later, between 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours.It is very important that you drink the required amounts of clear liquid during your treatment to replace the fluid that you will lose as your colon is emptied. You can use the dosing cup provided with your medication to measure your 8-ounce portions of liquid by filling the cup to the top line. You may find it easier to drink the full amount of liquid if you choose a variety of different clear liquid drinks.You will have many bowel movements during your treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination. Be sure to stay close to a toilet from the time you take your first dose of the medication until the time of your colonoscopy appointment. Ask your doctor about other things you can do to stay comfortable during this time.If you experience severe bloating or stomach pain after you take the first dose of this medication, wait until these symptoms go away before you take the second dose.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide."

Ertugliflozin is in a class of medications called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It lowers blood sugar by causing the kidneys to get rid of more glucose in the urine. Ertugliflozin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated).Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

It is usually taken the evening before and/or the morning of the procedure. Your doctor will tell you when you should begin taking PEG-ES, and whether you should take all of the medication at one time or take it as two separate doses. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take PEG-ES exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.You may not eat any solid foods or drink milk before and during your treatment with PEG-ES. You should only have clear liquids. Your doctor will tell you when to begin the clear liquid diet and can answer any question about which liquids are allowed. Examples of clear liquids are water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles, and soft drinks. Do not drink any liquid that is red or purple. You will need to drink a certain amount of clear liquids during your treatment to decrease the chance that you will become dehydrated as your colon is emptied. Tell your doctor if you have trouble drinking enough clear liquids during your treatment.You will need to mix your medication with lukewarm water so that it will be ready to drink. Read the directions that come with your medication to see how much water you should add to the powder and whether you should mix it in the container it came in or in another container. Follow these directions carefully and be sure to shake or stir the mixture so that the medication is mixed evenly. If your medication comes with flavor packets, you may add the contents of one packet to the medication to improve the taste, but you should not add any other flavorings to the medication. Do not mix your medication with any liquid other than water, and do not try to swallow the medication powder without mixing it with water. After you mix your medication, you may chill it in the refrigerator to make it easier to drink. However, if you will be giving the medication to an infant, you should not chill it.Your doctor will tell you exactly how to take PEG-ES. You will probably be told to drink one 8 ounce (240 mL) glass of PEG-ES every 10 or 15 minutes, and to continue drinking until your liquid bowel movements are clear and free of solid material. It is best to drink each glass of medication quickly instead of sipping it slowly. Dispose of any leftover medication that you use for this treatment.You will have many bowel movements during your treatment with PEG-ES. Be sure to stay close to a toilet from the time you take your first dose of the medication until the time of your colonoscopy appointment. Ask your doctor about other things you can do to stay comfortable during this time.You may experience stomach pain and bloating while you are taking your medication. If these symptoms become severe, drink each glass of medication slowly or allow more time between drinking glasses of medication. Call your doctor if these symptoms do not go away.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) if it is available for the brand of PEG-ES you are taking when you begin treatment with this medication.

Hormone replacement therapy works by replacing estrogen hormone that is no longer being made by the body. Estrogen reduces feelings of warmth in the upper body and periods of sweating and heat (hot flashes), vaginal symptoms (itching, burning, and dryness) and difficulty with urination, but it does not relieve other symptoms of menopause such as nervousness or depression. Estrogen also prevents thinning of the bones (osteoporosis) in menopausal women. Progestin is added to estrogen in hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of uterine cancer in women who still have their uterus."

It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin degludec must be used with another type of insulin (a short-acting insulin). In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin degludec may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin degludec is a long-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin degludec works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.

The person who is injecting naloxone for you can follow these directions, but he or she should know that it is not necessary to wait for the voice system to finish one direction before beginning the next step. Also, at times the voice system may not work and the person may not hear the directions. However, the device will still work and will inject the medication even if the voice system is not working.Symptoms of an opioid overdose include excessive sleepiness; not awakening when spoken to in a loud voice or when the middle of your chest is rubbed firmly; shallow or stopped breathing; or small pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes). If someone sees that you are experiencing these symptoms, he or she should give you your first dose of naloxone into the muscle or under the skin of your thigh. The medication may be injected through your clothing if necessary in an emergency. After injecting naloxone, the person should call 911 immediately and then stay with you and watch you closely until emergency medical help arrives. Your symptoms may return within a few minutes after you receive a naloxone injection. If your symptoms return, the person should use a new automatic injection device to give you another dose of naloxone. Additional injections may be given every 2-3 minutes if symptoms return before medical help arrives.Each prefilled automatic injection device should be used only once and then should be discarded. Do not try to replace the red safety guard on the auto-injection device after you remove it, even if you did not inject the medication. Instead, replace the used device in the outer case before discarding. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to safely dispose of used injection devices."

Metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin helps to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. Metformin also increases your body's response to insulin, a natural substance that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. Metformin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes."

If your symptoms do not go away completely after you use the first dose, your doctor may tell you to use a second dose after 5 minutes have passed and a third dose 5 minutes after the second dose. Call for emergency medical help right away if your chest pain has not gone away completely 5 minutes after you use the third dose.To use the spray, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nSit down if possible, and hold the container without shaking it.

Liraglutide injection (Victoza) is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated) in adults. Liraglutide injection (Saxenda) is used along with a reduced calorie diet and exercise plan to help certain adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh 132 pounds (60 kg) or more and who are obese or who are overweight and have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and to keep from gaining back that weight. Liraglutide injection (Saxenda) is not used to treat type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide injection is in a class of medications called incretin mimetics. It works by helping the pancreas to release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high. Insulin helps move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. Liraglutide injection also slows the emptying of the stomach and may decrease appetite and cause weight loss.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes."

It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation."

Sunitinib is also used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the kidneys). Sunitinib is also used to help prevent the return of RCC in people who have RCC that has not spread and have had a kidney removed. Sunitinib is also used to treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET, a type of tumor that begins in certain cells of the pancreas) in people with tumors that have worsened and cannot be treated with surgery. Sunitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors."

Tadalafil is sometimes taken as needed, usually at least 30 minutes before sexual activity and not more often than once every 24 hours. Your doctor will help you decide the best time for you to take tadalafil before sexual activity. Tadalafil is also sometimes taken once a day every day without regard to timing of sexual activity. You may attempt sexual activity at any time between doses. If you are taking tadalafil on a regular schedule, take it at around the same time every day. If you have certain health conditions or are taking certain medications, your doctor may tell you to take tadalafil less often or may prescribe a lower dose to be taken once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tadalafil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.If you are taking tadalafil to treat PAH or BPH, follow your doctor's directions and the guidelines in this paragraph. You should take tadalafil one time a day. Take all of the tablets for your daily dose at one time each day; do not divide the tablets to take as separate doses. Take tadalafil at around the same time every day. If you are already taking medication to treat BPH, your doctor may tell you to stop taking your other medication at least one day before starting treatment with tadalafil. Follow your doctor's directions carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.If you are taking tadalafil for erectile dysfunction, your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of tadalafil and increase or decrease your dose depending on your response to the medication. Tell your doctor if tadalafil is not working well or if you are experiencing side effects.If you are taking tadalafil for PAH, you should know that tadalafil controls PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take tadalafil even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tadalafil without talking to your doctor. Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient."

When calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with cataplexy, it is usually taken twice each night because calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night. When calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, it is usually taken once or twice each night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and a second dose is taken 2 1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.Do not take your bedtime doses of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate until you or your child are in bed and are ready to go to sleep for the night. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate begins to work very quickly, within 5 to 15 minutes after taking it. If your doctor has told you to take a second dose, place your second dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in a safe place near your bed (or in an safe place to give to your child) before sleep. Use an alarm clock to be sure that you will wake up in time to take the second dose. If you or your child wake up before the alarm goes off and it has been at least 2 1/2 hours since you took your first dose, take your second dose, turn off the alarm, and go back to sleep.Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate may be habit forming. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, you may experience life-threatening symptoms including seizures, slowed or stopped breathing, loss of consciousness, and coma. You may also develop a craving for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, feel a need to take larger and larger doses, or want to continue taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate even though it causes unpleasant symptoms. If you have taken calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in amounts larger than prescribed by your doctor, and you suddenly stop taking it, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness, anxiety, abnormal thinking, loss of contact with reality, sleepiness, upset stomach, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, sweating, muscle cramps, and fast heartbeat.Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, you may have more attacks of cataplexy and you may experience anxiety and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.To prepare doses of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nOpen the carton that your medicine came in and remove the bottle of medication and the measuring device.Remove the measuring device from its wrapper.Open the bottle by pushing down on the cap and turning the cap counterclockwise (to the left) at the same time.Place the open bottle upright on a table.Hold the bottle upright with one hand. Use your other hand to place the tip of the measuring device in the center opening on the top of the bottle. Press the tip firmly into the opening.Hold the bottle and measuring device with one hand. Use your other hand to pull back on the plunger until it is even with the marking that matches the dose your doctor prescribed. Be sure to keep the bottle upright to allow the medication to flow into the measuring device.Remove the measuring device from the top of the bottle. Place the tip of the measuring device in one of the dosing cups provided with the medication.Press down on the plunger to empty the medication into the dosing cup.Add 2 ounces (60 milliliters, 1/4 cup, or about 4 tablespoons) of tap water to the dosing cup. Do not mix the medication with fruit juice, soft drinks, or any other liquid.Place the cap on dosing cup. Turn cap clockwise (to the right) until it clicks and locks in place.To prepare a second dose, repeat steps 5 through 10 to prepare a dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate in a second dosing cup.Rinse the measuring device with water.Replace the cap on the bottle of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate and return the bottle and measuring device to a safe place where they are stored away from children and pets. Place prepared dosing cup(s) of medication in a safe place near your bed or in safe place to give your child that is out of the reach of children and pets.When it is time for you to take the first dose of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate, press down on the cap and turn it counterclockwise (to the left). Drink all of the liquid while you are sitting on your bed. Put the cap back on the cup, turn it clockwise (to the right) to lock it in place, and lie down right away.If you are taking a second dose, when you wake up 2 1/2 to 4 hours later to take the second dose, repeat step 14."

Insulin lispro injection products are also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products are always used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro injection products may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin lispro injection products are a short-acting, manmade version of human insulin. Insulin lispro injection products work by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. They also stops the liver from producing more sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes."

Do not inject where the skin is thick, lumpy, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, or into areas of skin where there are scars or skin is damaged. Always look at your insulin lispro product before you inject it. If you are using insulin lispro solution, the insulin should be clear and colorless. Do not use this type of insulin lispro product if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles. If you are using insulin lispro suspension, the insulin should appear cloudy or milky after you mix it. Do not use this type of insulin product if there are clumps in the liquid or if there are solid white particles sticking to the bottom or walls of the bottle. Do not use any type of insulin after the expiration date printed on the bottle has passed.Insulin lispro suspension must be gently shaken or rolled between your hands to mix before use. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if the type of insulin you are using should be mixed and how you should mix it if necessary.Insulin lispro solution (Admelog, Humalog U-100, Lyumjev U-100) also can be used with an external insulin pump. Before using insulin lispro products in a pump system, read the pump label to make sure the pump can be used for continuous delivery of fast-acting insulin. Read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the insulin pump. Do not dilute insulin lispro or mix it with any other type of insulin when using it with an external insulin pump. When using insulin lispro products with an external insulin pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days (Admelog, Humalog U-100,) or at least every 9 days (Lyumjev U-100), and change the infusion set and infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. If the infusion site is red, itchy, lumpy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site.When using insulin lispro solution in an external insulin pump, high blood sugar may occur quickly if the pump stops working properly or if the insulin in the pump reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures greater than 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen). Make sure you have back-up insulin and any necessary supplies on hand, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use them.This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information."

It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin detemir may be used with another type of insulin (a short-acting insulin). In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin detemir also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin detemir is a long-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin detemir works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease.
